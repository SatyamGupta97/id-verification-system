# ID-Card-Verifier-Project

 This project is an AI-powered ID card verification system that automates identity validation using computer vision and OCR technologies. It detects ID cards in images or live video streams, extracts text using EasyOCR, and verifies extracted information against a SQLite database of registered users. Built with Python and Ultralytics YOLOv8 for accurate detection, OpenCV for image processing, and Flask for an optional web interface, this project is designed for real-world applications such as security checkpoints, event access control, and identity verification services.

﻿#Key Features:

﻿#Real-time ID card detection with YOLOv8

﻿#OCR text extraction using EasyOCR for robust character recognition

﻿#SQLite database integration for fast and reliable user verification

﻿#Modular Python scripts for detection, cropping, OCR, and verification

﻿#Optional Flask web demo for seamless user interaction

This repository serves as a complete example for building AI-driven verification systems, ideal for learning, customization, and deployment.
